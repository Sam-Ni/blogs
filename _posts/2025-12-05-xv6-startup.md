This article introduces instructions to install xv6-riscv, which contains the following 3 steps.

## Clone the xv6-riscv Source Code

To begin, clone the [xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git
```

## Install QEMU and the RISC-V C Compiler

Follow the instructions on the [MIT website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2024/tools.html) to install the RISC-V versions of QEMU 7.2+, GDB 8.3+, GCC, and Binutils based on your operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL).

For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the tools by running:

```
sudo apt-get install git build-essential gdb-multiarch qemu-system-misc gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu 
```

## Compile and Launch xv6

Navigate to the root directory of the xv6 project and run:

```
make qemu
```

This will compile and launch xv6 in QEMU. Once the process completes, you should see the following message:


```
...

xv6 kernel is booting

hart 2 starting
hart 1 starting
init: starting sh
$
```

You can play with xv6 now!
